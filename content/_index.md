## What is Coherence?

Coherence is a generative art project.

## About the art

The machines create chaos, guided by our humanity into coherence. The artworks are inspired by the beauty and wonders of nature that are revealed to us through mathematics. The art comes to you from the ethereal world of numbers coalescing into a work of art worthy to hang on your wall.

## History

Coherence is among the first 5 generative art projects in the Solana network, having been launched in August 2021. In January 2022, the first Coherence collection on the Secret network was launched, also being one of the first to launch.
